    "After looking at the slices in the cells above and plotting interesting slices as well as circling interesting spots. We think that it might be interesting to see if the average intensity of the acquisitions are different between normal and abnormal brains. Ou reasoning is that in both T2 and T2 flair the inflammations have a light colour whereas in T1 inflammations have darker colour. Since inflammations are types of abnormalities we think that the verage intensities in T2 and T2 FLAIR will be higher in abnormal patients compared to normal patients. If this happens to be the case then it might be interesting to perform augmentations like gaussian smoothing. We will plot and inspect histograms of the average intensities for each acquisition of all patients over sets of slices, based ont these histograms we are hoping to draw conclusions that will guide us in our data preprocessing/augmentation.
