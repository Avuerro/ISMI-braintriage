    "The expectation that on average pixel intensity would be higher in T2 and T2 FLAIR does not seem to be correct based on the plot below and plots above. This can be explained by the fact that inflammations is just one type of abnormality. There are many things that could explain why a brain is abnormal, for example the ratio between white/gray matter or the amount of fat. However, we think that due to the variability in abnormality types a general pattern is hard to find without explicit knowledge of these abnormalities. We have therefore decided to only use center cropping and normalization for our data preprocessing. And flipping for our data augmentation we randomly flip on the x axis or rotating the brain with small angles \n",
