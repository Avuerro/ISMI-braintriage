# ISMI-braintriage: Team 3

This is the GitHub repository for our project for the Intelligent Systems in Medical Imaging course, in which we worked on the Brain Triage challenge. 

All of our code is contained within the `code` folder; the `images` folder contains some images that are relevant to our project. The `submission` folder contains the `.csv` files of our submissions to Grand Challenge.

The contents of the `code` and `images` folders are explained in our [Wiki](https://github.com/fbergh/ISMI-braintriage/wiki). The Wiki also contains an explanation of how to run our code in order to reproduce our results. An offline version is included in `ISMI-braintriage Wiki.pdf`.
